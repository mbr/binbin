binbin
======

``binbin`` is my personal ``~/bin`` folder and collects a variety of scripts
that are not large enough yet to warrant their own project.

Each file usually comes with a descriptive name, documentation inside the file
and, if you're lucky, a ``--help`` flag.


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most tools are self-containted and written in either Python or (if small
enough) shell script.

Some may require additional Python packages to be installed systemwide, the
most common being `click <http://click.pocoo.org>`_.


Applications
------------

Some programs come with ``.desktop`` files to fit neatly into whatever you are
using to launch your applications. Copy any of these to
``~/.local/share/applications``.


Other useful things
-------------------

Additional tools that would fit into binbin, but have grown enough to warrant
their own repository:
